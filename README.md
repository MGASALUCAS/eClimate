# ðŸŒ¦ðŸŒ¡ Weather Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ (98% acc.)

To reduce the workload of meterologist we have use Machine Learning to improve the accuracy of weather predictions. AI technologies process data in extreme weather conditions to help scientists with a better chance of alerting people in danger.
Leveraging the power of Data science solutios we have use Machine Learning models to predicts weather conditions and help farmers , Peoples and everyone with the neeed of accuracy weather information in their activities.
<br/>

Our models performane shows the unexpected output with acuracy of 98% .

# Documentation for Smart contract.
The smartcontract is written on solidity for facilitating funds financing through P2P transactions
this will help in solving issues of corruption since the decentralised system of blockchain works on 
principles of transparency https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/use-cases/ , also this will solve the problem of
high transaction costs and lack of proven funding models as the challenge was addresed by United Nations Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs https://sdgs.un.org/publications/state-city-climate-finance-17999

# Documentation for USSD part.

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol that is used to send text messages.
We have using this technology to help farmers with no access of Internet to get inofomation about weatehr condition based after predction made from our model.
Our USSD would be avalilbl to anyone with the need of accurate weather information , a user may also subscribe to get daily updates to help him or her the weather issues.
